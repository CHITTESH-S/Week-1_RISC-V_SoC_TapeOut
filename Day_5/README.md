## 🎯 Day 5 – Learning Objectives

🔎 Understand how synthesis tools **interpret RTL constructs** into hardware.

⚡ Identify **common pitfalls** that lead to unwanted latches or inefficient logic.

✅ Learn best practices for writing **synthesis-optimized if–else statements.**

🔲 Explore **correct usage and caveats of case statements.**

🔁 Differentiate between **for loops (unrolled logic)** and **for-generate loops (structural replication).**

🛡️ Apply coding techniques to **avoid synthesis mismatches** and ensure predictable hardware.
