## ðŸŒŸ RISC-V SoC Tapeout â€“ Week 1: Day 3 (Combinational and Sequential Optimizations)

Welcome to **Day 3** of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout journey!

> **Focus:** Practical techniques to improve combinational logic area/timing and sequential (register) optimization for robust, high-performance RTL â†’ netlist results.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- âœ… Understand common combinational optimizations (logic factoring, simplification, CSE, strength reduction).
- âœ… Learn sequential optimizations: pipelining, register retiming, flop merging and clock-domain considerations.
- âœ… Adopt Verilog coding patterns that are synthesisâ€‘friendly and produce clean netlists.
- âœ… Run Yosys flows to compare unoptimized vs optimized results and interpret `stat`/`show` outputs.
