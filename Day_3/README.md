## ðŸŒŸ RISC-V SoC Tapeout â€“ Week 1: Day 3 (Combinational and Sequential Optimizations)

Welcome to **Day 3** of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout journey!

> **Focus:** Practical techniques to improve combinational logic area/timing and sequential (register) optimization for robust, high-performance RTL â†’ netlist results.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

âœ… Understand common combinational optimizations (Constant Propogation, Boolean Logic Optimization, etc).
âœ… Learn sequential optimizations: Constant Propogation, State Optimization, Sequential Logic Cloning, Retiming, etc.
âœ… Adopt Verilog coding patterns that are synthesisâ€‘friendly and produce clean netlists.
âœ… Run Yosys flows to compare unoptimized vs optimized results and interpret `stat`/`show` outputs.
