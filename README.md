## ðŸŒŸ RISC-V SoC Tapeout â€“ Week-1: RTL Design Logic and Sysnthesis Using Sky130 PDK's

This repository covers **Week 1** of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout journey, focusing on **Verilog RTL design, simulation, waveform visualization, and logic synthesis**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Write **synthesizable Verilog RTL** designs  
- Verify designs using **Icarus Verilog** + **GTKWave**  
- Understand **testbench structure** and simulation workflow  
- Perform **logic synthesis** using **Yosys** with Sky130 PDK  
- Learn the role of **standard-cell libraries (.lib)** in timing and gate-level mapping  

---

## ðŸ“’ Day 1 - Focus Areas

- Introduction to **Verilog RTL design** and its role in digital systems.  
- Understanding **simulation workflow** using Icarus Verilog and waveform visualization with GTKWave.  
- Learning **testbench components**:  
  - **Stimulus Generator**: Provides input signals to the design.  
  - **Unit Under Test (UUT)**: The RTL module being verified.  
  - **Stimulus Observer**: Monitors outputs of the design.  
- Understanding **logic synthesis** using Yosys to convert RTL into gate-level netlists.  
- Exploring **standard-cell libraries (.lib)** and their impact on timing, power, and area optimization.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- **RTL Design** describes circuits at the register and logic level and is synthesizable.  
- **Simulation** ensures that the design behaves correctly before moving to hardware implementation.  
- **Testbenches** do not have primary inputs or outputs but drive and observe the design internally.  
- **Logic Synthesis** maps behavioral Verilog into gates using standard cells from a library.  
- **Cell Flavors**:  
  - Fast cells â†’ low delay, higher area/power.  
  - Slow cells â†’ prevent hold violations, may limit maximum frequency.  
- **Timing Awareness**: Setup and hold checks ensure reliable operation across different cell types.
